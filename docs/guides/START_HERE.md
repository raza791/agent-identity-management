├── docs/
└── cli/
```

### Test Locally
```bash
docker compose up -d
open http://localhost:3000
```

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Claude Gets Stuck
If Claude is stuck for > 30 minutes:
1. Review what's blocking it
2. Provide guidance or simplify requirement
3. Let it continue

### Technical Issues
If there are technical blockers:
1. Check Docker is running
2. Verify ports are available (5432, 6379, 9200, 3000, 8080)
3. Check environment variables

### Questions About Approach
Claude should make sensible decisions, but you can:
1. Review git commits to see what it's doing
2. Ask questions about specific choices
3. Override decisions if needed

---

## Tips for Success

### Let Claude Work Autonomously
- Don't micromanage - Claude knows the plan
- Trust the process - 30 hours is reasonable
- Review progress periodically (every 5-8 hours)

### Stay Available
- Claude might ask clarifying questions
- Be ready to approve major architectural decisions
- Provide feedback on UI/UX if needed

### Test as You Go
- Run `docker compose up` periodically
- Test features as they're built
- Catch issues early

## After the 30-Hour Build

### What to Do Next

#### 1. Review Everything
```bash
# Review git history
git log --stat

# Run all tests
npm test
go test ./...

# Start the platform
docker compose up -d
open http://localhost:3000
```

#### 2. Test Thoroughly
- Log in via SSO
- Register an agent
- Generate API key
- Check admin dashboard
- Review audit logs
- Test alerts

#### 3. Prepare for Launch
- Review README
- Test documentation
- Create demo video
- Write announcement blog post
- Prepare social media posts

#### 4. Go Public
- Push to GitHub (make public)
- Announce on Hacker News
- Submit to Product Hunt
- Share on Twitter/LinkedIn
- Post in relevant communities
